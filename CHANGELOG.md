### Changed
- Major internal refactoring and optimization:
  - Replaced synchronous file I/O with asynchronous I/O (`fs.promises`) for better performance.
  - Introduced caching for `.meta`, `.unity`, and `.prefab` files to speed up reference search.
  - Unified duplicate logic across multiple providers (`Hover`, `UsageScenePrefab`, `UnityEventMessage`, `TypeToggle`).
  - Simplified and optimized initialization flow in `extension.ts`.

### Added
- Unity Documentation Search now supports both:
  - Selected text, or
  - Word under the cursor (when no text is selected).

### Fixed
- Improved `.meta` file synchronization logic with more reliable handling of create/delete events.
- Enhanced class/method detection regex in `Parser` to reduce false positives.
